## *Simple Data Engeneer and Machine Learing using Databricks Community verion*

## *👩‍💻 I'm currently working on...*

### *Welcome to the Data Engeneer and Machine Learing Project repository!  -using Databricks Community verion-🚀*

*This project apply Simple Data Engeneer and Machine Learing, Using SQL and Python to generate actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.*

*Then will apply Machine learning Using Python to generate Predcited model by selcted the best one among diffirent ML Algorithms and tarck the experiences uding MLflow*

----------

*Data Engeneer Architecture :*

* *Raw Data : the raw data is ingsted in csv form into Databrisk Catalog workspace.*

*A. create a DATABASE.*

*B. Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems.*

*C. Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing,feature engeneering and data transformation.*

*D. Gold Layer: The Final data -In View Table- Ready for reporting ,analytics and Machine Laerning.*
